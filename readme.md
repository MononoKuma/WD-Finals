## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
Description of the project in detail.

This final project is a comprehensive collection of our previous projects, demonstrating our progress and understanding of the subject matter. By compiling these projects, we can clearly illustrate how our skills and knowledge have evolved over time. Early projects might show basic understanding and initial attempts at applying concepts, while later projects reflect more advanced techniques and a deeper grasp of the subject. The compilation serves as evidence of our growing comprehension, highlighting how we've applied theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios, tackled increasingly complex problems, and incorporated feedback to refine our work. This project not only presents finished products but also showcases our learning process, illustrating the journey of improvement, challenges faced, and solutions developed. By reviewing all our past work in one comprehensive project, we provide a holistic view of our educational experience, connecting the dots between different projects and showing how each contributed to our overall growth and understanding.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.
